# tts-internal-buy-starter-repo
A starter repo that every TTS internal buy can clone to get started.

## Instructions

For a project titled `Project X`, run the following to start a fresh repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/18F/tts-internal-buy-starter-repo.git
mv tts-internal-buy-starter-repo project-x
cd project-x
rm -rf .git
git init
echo "# Project X" > README.md
```

This pulls down the repository from GitHub, renames the folder, restarts the `git` commit history, and removes these instructions.
